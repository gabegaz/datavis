    "### Introduction\n",
    "There are a host of software packages, libraries and frameworks that help us visualize data. Some of these tools are embedded in bigger statistical packages such as Stata and SPSS. A well-known Python library for visualizing data, Matplotlib, is also available at your service. Collaborative decision making in any business operation is an important element in situations where different departments of an organization have stakes in those decisions. In these collaborative environments, data visualization should be available to all of the stake holders and be updated simultaneously for instantaneous decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the above mentioned software packages have their own places in other areas of statistical analysis, they are not convenient to share visualizations and insights online and on different platforms. As a data scientist, if you produce data visualization you should be able to share them through a platform agnostic system to all of the concerned decision makers (usually non-technical people) so that they can interactively play with the graph. You need to have a tool for doing just this. Plotly Dash serves this purpose."
