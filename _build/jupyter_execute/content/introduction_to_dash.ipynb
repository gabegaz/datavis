    "We will start off our journey of data visualization with the basics using Plotly Dash. Dash is an open source Python library built on top of Plotly.js, React and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical Python code. Itâ€™s maintained by Plotly, another visualization library which helps building, scaling, and deploying data apps in Python. To introduce you to what a simple Dash app looks like, let's create a simple visualization app with a small data set."
