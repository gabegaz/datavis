    "# Racing Bar Charts with Dash\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis on temporal observations (aka time series data) can be made in several ways. One traditional and most commonly used time series charts is to draw time on the x-axis and values of variables on the y-axis. This provides us with the behavior of a variable (e.g. trend, variability, seasonality and a basic view of whether that variable exhibits stationarity). A relatively newer way of looking at the dynamics of changes in the units of analysis with respect to a given variable is a racing chart (i.e. animated charts based on changes in the values of a variable over time). Racing charts can be used for different types of plots such as scatter plots, bar charts etc. In this tutorial, we will see how we can construct a racing bar chart."

    "## Installation and setup\n",
    "I use Python 3.9 for this section tutorial and is based on dash version 2.6.1 (which supports Python 3). Versions of dash before 2.0.0 also support Python 2. But it is preferable to work with Python 3 as Python 2 is no more supported by the Python software foundation as of 2020. Working in a virtual environment is advisable as it will create a sandbox for our project without disturbing other environments in your machine. Creating a virtual environment is easy. You can implement one of the few approaches available. You can use venv which comes with Python. In linux systems, you can run the following commands to create a virtual environment."

The second argument is just an optional argument (can be safely ignored for now). In the `Input`, the first argument is the id of the `dcc.Dropdown(...)` function in the layout section above.

The only difference is the value that this function expects comes from another function (the callback function.) There are three sections inside this function. Lets see each of them. The first one is determining the range of values in the y-axis. This is because, the relative size of loan disbursement, collection and outstanding values are different. Because we are drawing the bar charts on the same plot, huge differences in the range of the y-axis values distorts the charts. The code is pretty simple: if the column transferred through the callback function to this function is, for e.g. \"collection\", then set the range of values for this variable accordingly. Then, this information will be used to customize the graph yet to be constructed.\n",

    "Once you run your app from your machine. Make sure you have got a similar chart from your own browser like the one shown above.\n",

    "At first appearance, you will see an empty grid. You will see a dropdown menu just above the figure with a place holder that says “Select”. Select the variable of interest. As soon as you selected a variable to draw, a year slider appears below the chart. Press the `play` sign and see the year slider move. Because private banks joined the Ethiopian financial sector starting the late 1990’s, you won’t see any significant racing up until then. Furthermore, because there are several banks displayed on the legend, you may not see the chart very clearly on small devices (if, for e.g., you are reading this tutorial on mobile devices). Have a try on larger devices.\n",

    "There is one big bank (CBE short for Commercial Bank of Ethiopia) which dampened the relative importance of other banks. You can hide CBE from the race and try with the rest of the banks. You can easily do this by using the legend above the chart. You can click “CBE” once and its color fades away and you will not see “CBE” in the chart making the racing clearer. You can also use the control buttons at the top right of the chart. \n",
    "As you put the cursor closor to the controls, you can read their purpose such as reseting axis, zooming in and out. You can also download images it to your local machine."
