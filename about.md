# About this project

Data and information visualization is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information. The use of data visualization boils down to exploration and explanation of real world occurences. Any data visualization task follows a series of steps that include defining a question, collecting, cleaning, analyzing data (mainly through graphical representation of data) and share the insights with other people. The last point (i.e. sharing insights with someone else) is key to any data science project. 

Rather than producing a static graph, that shows only the intentions of the drawer, shareable and interactive charts help us see insights from different perspectives. In this project, we leverage Python programming language to visualize structured and unstructured data using different data sets. The focus will be on interactivity and shareablity of data visualization.

This project will consist of a series of separate standalone data visulaization tasks. However, for a better conceptual flow and to learn basics first before jumping to more advanced tasks, it is advisable to go through them consecutively.

I also write articles and hands-on projects on anything data on Medium [blog](https://medium.com/@gabegaz). If you have comments or issues with codes in this project, you can open an issues [here](https://github.com/gabegaz/datavis/issues). You can also contact me [here](https://www.gabegaz.com/resume).
